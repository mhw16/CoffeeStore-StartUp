# CoffeeStore-StartUp
Coffee store database and website created for a start up business. It was created during a database management course in graduate school (Fall 2017).
This is just a snapshot of what I have completed. The code created for the menu portion was completed by a colleague and is currently lost. 
The MS document lists the majority of MySQL code used to create the databases linked between the website and the WampServer64 phpMyAdmin databases (Used locally).

The first page:
http://localhost/"File-where-project-is-stored"/index.html

Requires WampServer or another database application in order to host the SQL code.
