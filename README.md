# CoffeeStore-StartUp
Coffee store database and website created for a start up business. It was created during a database management course in graduate school (Fall 2017).
This is just a snapshot of what I have completed. The code created for the menu portion was completed by a colleague and is currently lost. 
The MS document (CoffeShop Database.docx) lists the majority of MySQL code used to create the databases linked between the website and the WampServer64 phpMyAdmin databases (Used locally).

The first page:
http://localhost/"File-where-project-is-stored"/index.html

Requires WampServer or another database application in order to host the SQL code.

This completed portion of the project illustrates my ability to use PHP, HTML, and CSS to create the following for a website:
Registration page, login page, main menu, admin dashboard with tabs of pages to run the business, contact page, and shopping page

The tabs of the admin dashboard include the following linked to a SQL database: Insert employee record, view employee record, insert product, view products, and a logout
Functionality with the SQL database includes adding, editing, and deleting records/products. The database is also linked to the registration page, login page, and shopping pages.

This project also illustrates my ability to utilize SQL databases in conjunction with a start-up website.
